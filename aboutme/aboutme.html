    <h4>Hi, good people!</h4>
    <p>My name is Henrietta, I'm 19 (turning 20 really soon), and I'm from Nigeria but I live in <strong>Cambodia</strong> and have been living here for the past 15 years. For those of you who might not know, Cambodia is a small country in Southeast Asia, home to the Khmer language, the ancient ruins of <i>Angkor Wat</i>, and some incredibly nice people! I live here with my family. I'm the middle child with two siblings, my older brother (24) and my younger sister (11). My family has been members of the <i>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints</i> since moving here. In 2020, we had the amazing opportunity to visit the Manilla Temple in Phillipines and get sealed. I currently have a calling in Primary where I get to plan activities for the children.</p>
    <p>I've been taking online classes at BYU-I for the past two years. I'm majoring in <strong>Arts (Graphic Design)</strong> and I want to minor in <strong>Computer Programming</strong>. I've done some basic programming before in middle and highschool and I mostly enjoyed it. I love drawing, both traditionally and digitally, and would love to get into the field of graphic design, illustration, or animation as a career. I think good knowledge in computer programming would nicely aid that as so much of the creative field is moving on to the digital world everyday and I wouldn't want to fall behind. Along with taking online classes, I'm also a full-time teacher teaching lower elementary kids.</p>
    <p>Besides drawing, some of my hobbies include eating, watching movies and TV shows, listening to music, and spending time with friends. I love playing games and sports, <i>volleyball</i> and <i>football</i> are my favourite.</p>
